# InterScalactic

An ongoing demo project in React and Scala using Akka, Slick, and whatever else looks useful or interesting.

## Client

Demonstrates a concise system for managing React component state. 

## Server

The database layer is quite straight forward; it shovels futures from the database to the http threads on the routes. 

Prêt-à-hack.

## Run

Run the api server from sbt using class wafna.interscalactic.InterScalacticServer

Run the web server from npm at client/web.

Better still, run it all out of IDEA.
